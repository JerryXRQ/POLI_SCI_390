As shown by the plot above, the global export level started to take off after the end of World War II. Thanks to the growth of aviation and telecommunications technologies as well as reductions in the cost of sea freight, people across the world started to trade. Economics offers a great explanation for this phenomenon: although countries vary in their stages of development, they always have comparative advantages in the production of certain types of goods, and they can expand their production possibility frontier by trading. Furthermore, specialization can further drive down the cost of production. However, due to the pandemic and growing tension between China and the U.S., we are seeing a slowdown in this trend. As globalization comes under question and calls for decoupling start, we face some urgent questions. By writing this blog, I hope to address some of those issues. First, I want to discuss the relationship between export and economic growth. Second, I hope to address the validity of claims like globalization reduces income equality by reducing the need for domestic labor. Lastly, I will look at some factors that can help us predict the future of globalization.
