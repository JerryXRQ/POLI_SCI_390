As shown by the plot above, the global export level started to take off after the end of World War II. Thanks to the growth of civil aviation technologies and reduction in the cost of merchant marines, people across the world started to trade. Economics offer a good explanation for this phenomena: because countries have comparative advantages in producing different goods and services, they can expand their production possibility and benefit mutually from trading. However, due to the pandemic and growing tension between China and the U.S., we are seeing a slowdown in this trend. As the export growth starts to slowdown, we are faced with some urgent questions. First, what role does export play in the development of countries like China. Second, does globalization causes workers in developed nations to lose their jobs and expand the wealth gap as a result.
