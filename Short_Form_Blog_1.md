The writer used this plot to support his claim that COVID-19 is more dangerous than flu in South Korea, a country with relatively low COVID death rates. However, the comparison between the death rates of flu in the US and COVID in South Korea is flawed due to the failure to control variables. If the US is good at protecting its people against deaths caused by flu, this graph will not back the writer’s message. At the same time, the plot offers little information about how the COVID death rate in Korea compares to that in other countries. The writer needs to consider the type and source of information used in his article.

This plot from McKinsey is a good example. First, to show the widespread growth of e-commerce, it uses a range of developed and developing countries. It also directly presents how the previous growth rate compares to the 2020 value, which is helpful because it highlights the main point and avoids bar charts' weakness in illustrating relative size. Additionally, the writers anticipated that the readers might doubt the significance of the change in growth rate. Therefore, they included the percentage of e-commerce in total retail sales. Because those values are high in the countries selected, we know that the trend is valid.
