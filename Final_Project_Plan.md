# Final Project Plan

The question I want to answer for the final project is the impact of globalization on different countries. To be more specific, I want to focus on two key claims: globalization fosters economic growth around the world but increases the wealth gap in developed countries. Additionally, I want to make some predictions about global trade. For the first point, I want to look at the GDP, income, and export. If there is a correlation between export and factors like GDP, then we should be able to conclude that globalization does facilitate economic growth. For the second point, we can use indicators like the Gini coefficient, unemployment rate, and import to see if shifting production to other countries exacerbates inequalities. For predicting the future of global trade, some useful indicators include the supply chain pressure index, changes in trade partnerships, and trade policies. The links to some of those sources are included below.

Some good visualizations include the trade and globalization article from Our World in Data, which contains plots showing the relationship between GDP and export, trade partnerships by income levels, and export destinations. Additionally, the map of export as a percentage of GDP offers some interesting insights into which countries depend heavily on trade. There is also an article from Harvard Business Review containing some visualizations of trends in trade, investment, and international travel. It would be nice to find the data source and replicate some of that. I have included the links below.
