# Final Project Plan

The question I want to answer for the final project is the impact of globalization on different countries. To be more specific, I want to focus on two key claims: globalization fosters economic growth in developing nations and increases the wealth gap in developed countries. Additionally, I want to make some predictions about global trade. For the first point, I want to look at the GDP, income, and export. If there is a correlation between export and factors like income, then we should be able to conclude that globalization does facilitate economic growth. For the second point, we can use indicators like the Gini coefficient, unemployment rate, and import to see if producing goods in other countries exacerbates inequalities. For predicting the future of global trade, some useful indicators include the supply chain pressure index, changes in trade partnerships, and trade policies.

Some good visualizations include the trade and globalization article from Our World in Data, which contains plots showing the relationship between GDP and export, trade partnerships by income level, and export destinations. There is also an interesting article from Harvard Business Review containing some visualizations of trends in trade, investment, and international travel. I have included the links below.
