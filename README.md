# Jerry Xu's Homepage for Political Science 390

## Purpose of this site

The purpose of this site is to document my work for POLI_SCI 390 Data Visualization class. I will share some examples of good and bad visualizations as well as my writings with data visualizations. In doing so, I hope to demonstrate the skills I have learned.

## A bit about me

I am a senior at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I am interested in developing high-performance hardware optimized for specific workloads. After graduation, I plan to attend grad school for a master's or Ph.D. degree. By taking this class, I hope to learn some tools for crafting effective messages with data and identifying misleading information.

Outside of school, I enjoy running and playing badminton. You can sometimes find me running along the lake shore.
